                        The wifi network in my home started randomly failing as the all in one router began to die. To fix this issue I reaserched and recomended that we switch to a Ubiquiti based system for better management, wifi, and configuration. <br><br>
                        I assisted in the installation of the system, then greated a network diagram so we could see which devices were connected to which port on the swich <br> <br>
                        The result is no network complaints since install
