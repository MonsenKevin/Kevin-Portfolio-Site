                        Diagnosed recurring wireless network failures caused by a degrading all-in-one consumer router.
                        After evaluating replacement options, recommended migrating to a Ubiquiti-based network to
                        improve reliability, visibility, and configuration control. <br> <br>
                        Assisted with the installation and configuration of Ubiquiti networking hardware, including
                        access points and switching infrastructure. Following deployment, created a detailed network
                        diagram documenting device connections and switch port assignments to improve long-term
                        maintainability and troubleshooting. <br> <br>
                        Since the migration, the network has operated reliably with no reported connectivity issues.
