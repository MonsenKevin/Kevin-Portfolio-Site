                        As Secretary for Ohlone Lodge, led a full redesign and migration of the organization’s website
                        to improve usability, maintainability, and performance. Within one week, migrated all existing
                        content from the legacy site to a new WordPress-based platform while preserving accuracy and
                        continuity. <br> <br>
                        WordPress was selected intentionally to support non-technical future site administrators. While
                        a custom HTML/CSS/JavaScript solution was possible, prioritizing long-term usability and ease of
                        content management enabled future secretaries to update the site without technical barriers.
                        This user-focused approach informed key architectural decisions throughout the project. <br> <br>
                        Following the redesign, investigated performance degradation and identified issues caused by
                        residual plugin files and insufficient hosting resources. Cleaned up unused assets and evaluated
                        alternative hosting providers to improve site performance and cost efficiency.
                        After selecting WP Engine as a suitable hosting solution, collaborated with other members of the
                        site team to plan and execute the hosting migration. <br> <br>
                        The final result is a responsive, performant, and easy-to-maintain website designed to support
                        the organization’s needs for years to come.
