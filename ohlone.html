                        When I became Secretary for Ohlone Lodge my main goal was to redesign the website. Over the course of a week I moved all the content off our old website and on to our new one. <br><br>
                        Why WordPress? While I could have figured out HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; I knew that future secretaries might not be a technical. By building on WordPress I enabled anyone to add content to our website. This thought of the future user dominates many of my desisons on technology architecture. <br> <br>
                        After completing the redesign of the website I noticed that it was getting very slow. After investigating I found that some of the issues were being caused by extra files left by removed plug ins, but most of it was because the server we were using wasn't fast enough. <br><br>
                        To fix this I researched new hosts that could give us better pricing and performace. Once I identified WP Engine as a suitable host I worked with other members of the site team to migrate our hosting.br <br> <br>
                        The result is a resposive, easy to update site that should serve them well for years to come
