                        Orchestrated a critical infrastructure upgrade for the Ohlone Lodge (Pacific Skyline Council),
                        transitioning 50+ users from a legacy Network Solutions environment to Google Workspace for
                        Nonprofits. The primary objective was to eliminate recurring hosting costs while establishing a
                        modern, secure communication stack. <br> <br>
                        The technical execution involved navigating complex validation protocols with Google Support and
                        TechSoup to secure non-profit eligibility. I utilized Google's Data Migration Service (DMS) to
                        transfer historical data, mapping legacy addresses to personal accounts. By lowering DNS TTL
                        settings prior to the switch, I achieved a zero-downtime transition during the cutover. <br> <br>
                        A key innovation of this project was engineering a solution for "Two-Deep Leadership" safety
                        compliance. I configured the email architecture to function as a routing layer; emails sent to
                        youth leadership positions are now automatically forwarded to both the youth member and a
                        designated adult advisor. <br> <br>
                        This automated routing ensures strict adherence to youth protection policies without relying on
                        manual cc'ing. The project resulted in 100% savings on annual email fees ($200/yr), improved
                        deliverability via authenticated DKIM/SPF records, and a safer digital environment for the
                        organization. <br> <br>
