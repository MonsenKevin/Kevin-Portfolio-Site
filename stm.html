                        Designed and developed a professional marketing website for Scottsdale Technology Management
                        using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project focused on creating a clear, engaging user
                        experience while maintaining a simple, maintainable technical stack. <br><br>
                        The site features a looping video landing section to immediately engage visitors and establish
                        brand presence. Service offerings are organized into three clearly defined tiers, using
                        consistent branding and color hierarchy to improve readability and guide prospective clients
                        through available options. <br><br>
                        An About Us section was implemented to clearly communicate the company’s identity, values, and
                        scope of services, helping establish credibility with potential clients. <br><br>
                        The website was deployed using GitHub Pages, providing a reliable and cost-effective hosting
                        solution well-suited for static business websites. <br><br>
