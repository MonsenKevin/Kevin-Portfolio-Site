                        As part of an Introduction to Engineering course, collaborated on the design and construction of
                        a wearable assistance device intended to improve safety for visually impaired users. The goal
                        was to address hazards above waist level—an area not detectable by traditional white canes and a
                        common source of injury. <br> <br>
                        The system combined computer vision and proximity sensing to detect obstacles and provide
                        real-time feedback to the user. A camera captured images of the surrounding environment, which
                        were analyzed via an AI vision API to identify nearby obstacles. When an obstacle was detected,
                        a vibration motor provided tactile feedback to warn the user. <br> <br>
                        In parallel, an ultrasonic sensor continuously measured distance to nearby objects. If an object
                        entered a defined safety threshold, an audible buzzer was triggered to provide an additional
                        alert. This multi-sensor approach improved reliability by combining AI-based recognition with
                        direct distance measurement. <br> <br>
                        The final prototype demonstrated how layered sensing and feedback mechanisms can enhance user
                        awareness and reduce the risk of head-level collisions.  <br> <br>
